        <img src="myphoto.jpg" alt="Image of me">
        <p>I am majoring in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I love to read, do things outside like camping or wandering around in the middle of nowhere, swimming, and doing things on the computer.</p>
        <p>I am taking this course to expand my knowledge of the coding languages so that I have diverse and versitile skillset that allows me to take on almost any coding project.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for my whole life. My favorite talk is from Elder Holland titled "The First Great Commandment" and one of my favorite scriptures is Isaiah 43:1 "But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not:for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by name; thou art mine."</p>
        <p>My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson and my favorite series of his is The Stormlight Archive. You should definitely take a look at it.</p>
